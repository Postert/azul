#  Privacy policy

azul does not collect or send information of any kind. The software runs locally on your computer and does not capture any analytics. We do not know if you download the software or what datasets you use it with.

If you open an issue on GitHub, whatever you write will be visible to others. If you want to send details privately, you can e-mail the developer (Ken Arroyo Ohori).
